# Final Project Part II - Wireframes, User research

## Introduction 
How introduction will look like: Giving information about the disease and how it affects.

## Four epidemiological stages of IBD seen 
All the four stages will be spoken about in detail for user information.

## Factors leading to increase in prevalence in India.

All the factors will be explained.

## Management of IBD compared to other countries.

Each management will be included in the information paragraph.

## Timeline of IBD in India and the urgency for management.

## User research and interviews.
The user research and interviews aim at making this project more impactful to the health policy makers to
to create change is the management of India's IBD policies. The feedbacks and replies collected from the 
user research will help in building a better story model for the project. The interviwees selected were peers
from the health policy department, as they would understand the impact of a story needed to pass a policy. 

## Interview script: 
Q1. Did the prompt here give you a basic idea of the disease and its progression? 
Q2. What can you conclude about the epidemiological progression of IBD in India compared to other countries?
Q3. Do the factors give you an idea what changes can be taken to control disease prevalence?
Q4. How does the IBD management in other countries make you feel about management in India?
Q5. Did you find the information you were looking for?

## Feedbacks and replies from the interview:
- All the interviwees said there should be more data supporting the epidemiological map of the world by making 
  it clear to read. 
- Add extra graph just talking about the emergence epidemiological stages in India only. 
- The timeline visualization could be made into a time-series graph rather than the bar graph.
- The data is supported well with the visualization but few other kinds of visualizations can be used other than 
  bar charts.
  
## Changes made after receiving feedback from the interview. 
1. The timeline bar graph was changed to time-series graph to show the slope of progression in decades which 
   gives clear impact of the increasing prevalence in India.

2. The feedback suggested to add a graph to show India individually passing through epidemiological phases.

3. Use of graphs other than bar charts.

The above given changes will be implemented in the final presentation to create the necessary impact for the 
targetted audience.
