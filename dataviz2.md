# Data visualization methods
The different data visualization methods used are Bar chart, Grid line chart, Scatter plot chart. 
The bar chart is different from grid line and scatter plot chart in terms of displaying the data of countries individuallyfrom 1995 to 2019. 
The grid line chart and scatter plot chart might look similar but the dots in the scatter plot gives proper information on the scale than the grid line. 
The bar chart is easier to compare the countries with each other but is constrained to only certain time period where as the grid line and scatter plot gives a large timeline to compare individual countries progess. 
The data is sourced from official OECD website and explains the GDP for the group of countries in OECD. I chose the scatter plot chart to plot each country's growth from 1995 to 2019 and can cleary indicate the GDP on the scale and can be read easily by the readers.
