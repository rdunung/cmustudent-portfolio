This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!
# About me
Hi all, I am Ruchita Dunung, first-year Healthcare Policy & Management student. I am a Dentist from Mumbai, India. I have worked in Mumbai as a dentist for 3 years after which I decided to move into management in healthcare sector and enrolled at CMU! After graduating, I wish to use the skills learnt at CMU to positively impact the healthcare system. I am a Potterhead who loves Star Wars and food. Also, I am scared of dentists and ghosts.
# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to make data fun but also clear and comprehensible. It would be great to learn how to concise complex data into visualizations. Also, coming from a clinical background it will be helpful to get an experience at coding.
