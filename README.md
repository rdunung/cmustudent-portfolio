# About me
Hi all, I am Ruchita Dunung, first-year Healthcare Policy & Management student. I am a Dentist from Mumbai, India. I have worked in Mumbai as a dentist for 3 years after which I decided to move into management in healthcare sector and enrolled at CMU! After graduating, I wish to use the skills learnt at CMU to positively impact the healthcare system. I am a Potterhead who loves Star Wars and food. Also, I am scared of dentists and ghosts.
# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to make data fun but also clear and comprehensible. It would be great to learn how to concise complex data into visualizations. Also, coming from a clinical background it will be helpful to get an experience at coding.

# Data visualization critique by Stephen Few's method and re-designing
<https://rdunung.github.io/cmustudent-portfolio/dataviz3>
This is a data visualization execise that used Stephen Few's Effectiveness method to critique the original data visualization and use the critique to create a wireframe on its 
basis. The wireframe was then shown to unbiased people for feedbacks. These feedbacks were used to create a final visualization.
