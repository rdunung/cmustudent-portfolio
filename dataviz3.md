# Most Common Hospital Related Infections
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036829/figure/ijerph-17-00760-f001/>

The data visualization displayed is a grouped bar graph of various pathogens causeing infections in different departments of the hospital. I chose this data to create an 
impact and shed light on the pathogens present in various places in the hospital causing secondary infection in patients that are already being treated for their primary diseases. 
They cause discomfort and fatality to the existing patients and staff of the hospital. The original visualization shows 6 types of pathogens and the percentage of infections they cause 
in specific departements. The graph is simple but overcrowded with a distracting colour palatte. Hence, I chose this graph to declutter it and convey the necessary information needed.

# Process of re-designing!
The critique method followed to re-design the visualization is the Stephen Few's Data Effectiveness Profile. This profile helps critique the visualization by reviewing its effectiveness 
and emotional quotient. The original graph had a good effectiveness index with a good usefulness, validity, perceptibility but lacks understanding and redear's appeal. 
My wireframes were based on this critique and made sure that the overcrowding did not repeat and an appropriate colour palatte was used for the final visualization. 
Therefore, instead of using the grouped bar chart I used the stacked bar chart to declutter and reduce overcrowding. This led to less distraction in terms of information
and led the reader directly to the necessary information thus, making an impact required. Also for the wireframes, I introduced labels for the X and Y axes as well as legend for the graph.
The labels and the legend give clear understanding about what to look at in the visualization.

# Wireframe

The wireframes by viewed by two people who provided feedback by answering the questions about the visualization. The most common and useful feedback the visualization of the wireframe
were including values of the percentages, adding a trend line, etc. The feedbacks helped me refine the wireframe for the final viz. I added the percentages to make it more impactful and readable for the reader. The re-designed visualiztion creates a greater impact in terms of portraying the percentage of infection in each department and feedbacks were a proof to the impact made as they mentioned that they could 'understand the bad infections in ICU and surgical area of the hospital.' The decluttering helped bring attention to important information in the bar graph. I also changed the colour palatte to increase and refine its emotional quotient for the audidence. The blue and green colour shades were best used to focus attention on the labels and numbers in the graph. 
These changes to the original data visualization and wireframe helped create the final visualization.
