# Summarising the Final Project
My final project part 3 contained few changes that were made to final project part 2. Following are the changes made:
- Labellings were removed from the visualization for the digestive system. 
- Created two additional visualizations to show the difference between management of IBD in India and in Western regions. 
  two bar charts were created, one for percentage of colonoscopies and other for percentage of biologics used for 
  treatment of IBD in India and Western regions. 
- Added another bar chart to show India on the graph comparing the percentage of IBD population compared to USA, Japan,
  South Korea and Europe. This helped understand that India is only second to USA in the increasing percentages of IBD.

# Thoughts:
  It was a great experience learning data visualizations in this class. Every visualization I see now is more clear and 
  detailed than before. I tried to find a way I could maybe improve it and try to work on the visualizations presented. 
  The final project was a cumulative of parts 1,2 and 3. It was fun working on it. Thank you!
