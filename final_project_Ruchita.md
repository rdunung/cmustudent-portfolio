## Final Project Part I - Outline, Sketches, Data. 

# Outline

Coming from a medical background, one of the most pressing issues I have come across is the increasing prevalance of Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD),
in Southeast Asia, especially in India. The project gives an outlook of the disease and its epidemiology in India compared to other countries where
it is prevalent. It will help the reader understand the disease and the reason for its increasing prevalence and different ways of managing it in 
India and other countries. This project is intended to bring attention to IBD and spread awareness to create better treatment options and conditions
for the existing and future IBD patients in India.

# Data for the final project 

1. What is IBD? 
<https://www.cdc.gov/ibd/what-is-IBD.htm> This data answers the question of What is IBD? and introduces the reader to the disease and its information. 
Knowing about the disease will help the reader understand the seriousness of the disease which will help create awareness for the same. As anything 
related to excretion is a stigma in India, understanding the disease more closely will help desensitize the audience. 

2. <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-020-00360-x#Tab1> The data from this source will help in portraying the different epidemiological phases of IBD
and categorize each country with respect to India, and also show which phase does India belong to in the epidemiological divison. It gives an overlook 
into the future of IBD globally. 

3. <https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/465522> This data will help understand why IBD occurence is rising in India. The factors leading to the increase
if portrayed impactfully, can create awareness to take prevent measures to control the rising occurence. 

4. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5037081/> This data source will provide an important factor highlighting India's past, present, and future
for the Irritable Bowel Disease. It answers an important question of Why India is seeing an increase in prevalance of IBD? It will also provide data 
to portray the increase in terms of visualization which will speak largely to the audience. The impact of the visualization can help create the 
necessary awareness for the disease. 

5. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2579633/> , 
<https://www.biospectrumindia.com/views/69/16693/inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-india-treatment-strategy.html> This data source helps understand 
how IBD is managed in Eastern Europe, as the disease occurence there is the highest compared to India. This data will help to compare the different 
managemnent methods used in Europe and India. Comparing the management of IBD in a place of high prevalance to Indian management can help open 
different treatment options for the Indian IBD patients. 

# Intended platforms to use for project completion

The platform I hope to use are Shorthand, Flourish, and Tableau. Shorthand will be used to make and execute the idea proposed for the project with few interactive 
graphs and visualizations. Flourish and Tableau will be used to make certain graphs which will be included in Shorthand to submit the final project proposed idea. 

Shorthand will help present the final presentation by using interactive but informational interface for the audience to emphasize on the topic discussed.
The presentation will be sequenced to form a storyline for the audience to make it capturing and interesting enough to create an impact. The above provided
sketches provide a preview of how some interactive visualization might look.
I hope to use Tableau to create map story to portray the global epidemiology sketch. This will give an overview of the issue and will be easy on the reader's 
eyes and thinking.
Next, I hope to use Flourish to create graphical visualizations as it provides various representations to create interesting graphs. These graphs will help 
create impact with the use of graphical but numerical method. 
I hope all this will be tied together into an interactive, interesting and impactful visualization with information.
